/**
 * The Visitor Pattern could help us to decouple the operation details for a particular visitable object from
 * multiple visitor objects. We isolate the responsibilities in the separate visitor objects
 * (such as EyeDoctor, SLP & Parent) when those objects need to implement their own logic for the visitableObject(Kid).
 * Refer {@link http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/42240/Visitor-Design-Pattern} for real example
 * and {@link http://www.javaworld.com/javatips/jw-javatip98.html} for java example

/**
 * Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm.
 * Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of
 * equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by
 * John von Neumann in 1945.[1]
